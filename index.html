        <p>I'm lead developer in Free Pro's R&D lab.</p>
        <p>I grew up in the south of France, studied in Paris and have been living in Sussex since 2020.</p>
        <p>I was CTO of a mobility start-up from 2020 to 2023 and was able to industrialise and optimise the
            development of this Saas. I did a lot of SRE, CI/CD/devops and performance optimisation on the backend,</p>
        <p>From 2005 to 2020 I worked in an IT services company for major accounts. As a fullstack developer in Java
            and PHP, then as a Python lead dev.</p>

        <p>I designed and developed several web applications on my own, including exDom and Ve9etal.

            is my laboratory; it's a NodeJS+MySQL stack, with a full text search. It's also a <acronym

                <acronym title="Trusted Web App">TWA</acronym>
            </a>, rated 4x100 on LightHouse, and <acronym
                title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</acronym>-compliant - this portfolio website is also
            4x100 and WCAG
            compliant.
            I'm passionate, self-taught and love to learn.
        </p>

        <p>For several years I've been passionate about software craftmanship, clean code and accessibility.
            I'm also very keen on automation, such as CI/CD, to make developers' lives easier.
            I believe in the Kiss philosophy and am committed to developing simple, robust, scalable and
            maintainable SaaS.
